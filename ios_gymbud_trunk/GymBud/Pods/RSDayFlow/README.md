> [RSDayFlow](https://github.com/ruslanskorb/RSDayFlow) is a slim fork of [DayFlow](https://github.com/evadne/DayFlow) with updates and extensions:

> * Possibility to mark the date
* 2 colors of marks that can be used in the Task Manager (gray color - days with uncompleted tasks, green color - days with completed tasks)
* Design like iOS 7
* Some other updates

iOS 7 Date Picker + Infinite Scrolling.

## Play

Look at the [Sample App](https://github.com/ruslanskorb/RSDayFlow-Sample). Have fun. Make it faster. Fork and send pull requests. Figure out hooks for customization.

## Use

Plop `RSDFDatePickerView` in, and implement the one method in `<RSDFDatePickerViewDelegate>`:

	- (void)datePickerView:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view didSelectDate:(NSDate *)date;
	
Or implement the one method in `RSDFDatePickerViewDataSource`:

	- (NSDictionary *)datePickerViewMarkedDates:(RSDFDatePickerView *)view;

That pretty much sums up what it does.
